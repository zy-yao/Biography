The EY NextWave Data Science Challenge 2019 focuses on how data can help the next smart city thrive, and boost the mobility of the future. 

Our task is to produce a model that helps authorities to understand the journeys of citizens while they move in the city throughout the day. Specifically, this competition's goal is to predict the location of this last exit point and whether this device is within the city center or not. Systematic data mining and processing ideas are used here. I am glad to share them.
