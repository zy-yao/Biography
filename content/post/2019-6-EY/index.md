EY NextWave Data Science competition 2019 focuses on how data can help the next smart city thrive, and boost the mobility of the future.  In this competition, systematic data mining and processing ideas are used here. I am glad to share them.

### 1.Understand the problem

#### 1.1 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the anonymized geolocation data of multiple mobile devices in the City of Atlanta (US) for 11 working days in October 2018. There are approximately 210,000 devices and 11 columns in the dataset.

Our task is to produce a model that helps authorities to understand the journeys of citizens while they move in the city throughout the day. Specifically, this competition's goal is to predict the location of this last exit point and whether this device is within the city center or not. The variables in the dataset are as follows:

### 3.Prospect

Hopefully, our work could inspire solutions that help city authorities anticipate disruptions, make real-time decisions, design new services, and reshape infrastructures in order that cities as smart as their citizens.
