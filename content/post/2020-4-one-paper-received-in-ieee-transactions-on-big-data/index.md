We mine the task patterns from the large volume of historical allocation data and propose a reinforcement learning model termed IRDA to learn the allocation strategy in an incremental way. 

The experimental results show that IRDA is capable of incrementally learning from multi-batch datasets, and improves the baggage carousel resource utilization by around 51.86% compared to the current baggage carousel allocation system at HKIA.
