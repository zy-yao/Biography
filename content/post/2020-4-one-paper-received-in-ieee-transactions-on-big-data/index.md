Our paper, *IRDA: Incremental Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation*, is accepted in IEEE Transactions on Big Data. This is a journal paper.

We mine the task patterns from the large volume of historical allocation data and propose a reinforcement learning model termed IRDA to learn the allocation strategy in an incremental way.
