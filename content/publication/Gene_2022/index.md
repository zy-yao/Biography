Bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) is a complex disease with high morbidity and mortality. 
Changes in alternative splicing (AS) and splicing factor (SF) can affect gene expression, thus playing an essential role in tumorigenesis. 
This study downloaded 412 patients' clinical information and 433 samples of transcriptome profiling data from TCGA. 
And we collected 48 AS signatures from SpliceSeq. LASSO and Cox analyses were used for identifying survival-related AS events in BLCA. 
Finally, 1,645 OS-related AS events in 1,129 genes were validated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis, ROC analysis, risk curve analysis, and independent prognostic analysis. 
Finally, our survey provides an AS-SF regulation network consisting of five SFs and 46 AS events. In the end, we profiled genes that AS occurred in pan-cancer and five SFsâ€™ expression in tumor and normal samples in BLCA. 
We selected CLIP-seq data for validation the interaction regulated by RBP. 
Our study paves the way for potential therapeutic targets of BLCA.
