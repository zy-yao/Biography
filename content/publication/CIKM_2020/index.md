Rule-constrained resource allocation aims to evenly distribute tasks to different processors under the constraints of a set of allocation rules. Conventional heuristic approach fails to achieve optimal solution while simple brute force method has the defects of extremely high computational complexity.
To address these limitations, we propose ‚Äúrecursive balanced k-subset sum partition (RBkSP)‚Äù, in which iterative ‚Äúcut-oneout‚Äù policy is employed that in each round, only one subset is partitioned whose weights of tasks sum up to 1/ùëò of the
total weight of all tasks in the set. In a single partition, we
first create a dynamic programming table with its elements
recursively computed, then use ‚Äúzig-zag search‚Äù method to
explore the table and find out elements with optimal subset
partition, finally assign them to different places. Afterwards,
to resolve conflicts during allocation, we use heuristic method
which is simple but effective to adjust the allocation of tasks
that are contradicted to specific rules. Testing results show
RBkSP can achieve more balanced allocation with lower
computational complexity over classical benchmarks.
